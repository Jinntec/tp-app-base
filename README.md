# tp-app-base

Base image for Tei_Publisher generated apps, without autodeployed stock apps, but centraly configurable tei-publisher dependencies.

Automatic builds run daily on CI. Images are published to GitHubs container Registry. To pull:

```shell
docker pull ...
```

The images have basic production optimizations applied.
